Albums is a simple project code in React Native to test my skills on it.
I fetch a collection of albums of Taylor Swift and display the information ans images on different cards. You can scroll on the screen and if you want to buy one it links you to Amazon web site.

Simply as that !

#### How does it works ? ###
run ``npm install``
then 
``react-native run-ios``
to see the result in the iOS simulator

or 
``react-native run-android``
to see the result in the android simulator
